## Usage
### Fairness
_!!!DON'T COPY OTHER PEOPLES TESTS!!!_
### Install
This project uses [clintest](https://potassco.org/clintest/) to run the tests. Follow the instructions there.

To get it running: just clone into the directory your MartianAP.lp is located!
### Run Tests
just execute runTests.py
### Add Tests
It's highly encouraged to add your own tests and share them (make a pull request I guess) - this way you can help others find their bugs - or even find bugs in your solution!
Add \<yourname\>_\<testname\>.lp to the tests directory.
Then, add \<yourname\>\_\<testname\> to the results directory.
Format: for each answer set, add a line with the clingo output (it's important to add all, since it's gonna test for it), if no output is there add an empty file.

_Important_: don't add empty lines in the end!
