## Usage
### Install
this project uses [clintest] (https://potassco.org/clintest/) to run the tests. Follow the instructions there.
### Run Tests
just execute runTests.py
### Add Tests
Add \<yourname\>_\<testname\>.lp to the tests directory.
Then, add \<yourname\>\_\<testname\> to the results directory.
Format: for each answer set, add a line with the clingo output (it's important to add all, since it's gonna test for it), if no output is there add an empty file.

_Important_: don't add empty lines in the end!
